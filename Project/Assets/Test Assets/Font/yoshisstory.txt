Yoshi's Story  Compiled by Brian Kent

Thanks for Downloading Yoshi's Story.


  The characters in this font are from the game 'Yoshi's Story' for the
N64.  Throughout the game, the info is displayed as animated text (3 frames
of animation).  I took a picture (with my Digital Camera) of each frame of
animation on the High Score Name Entry screen.  Then made a font out of the
Frame that looked the best.
